# Project ***Swipe!***

A simple digitization of a *very* complicated boardgame I made, called ***swipe!***

Visit the `index.html` file in a web server to see the game, this is currently running on github pages https://projectswipe.netlify.app. 

## Running Locally

You just need a web server running, no build necessary! Use whatever static web server you like

Node static web server example:

* Install node.js 
* Run `npx serve`
