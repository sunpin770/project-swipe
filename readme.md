# Excalibur Vanilla JS Template

This is an example of how to create a new Excalibur game only in vanilla JS.

In this example we use ES modules to import script files and unpkg to load the excalibur library into the `ex` global.

Visit the `index.html` file in a web server to see the game, this is currently running on github pages https://excaliburjs.com/template-vanilla-js/index.html

## Running Locally

You just need a web server running, no build necessary! Use whatever static web server you like

Node static web server example:

* Install node.js 
* Run `npx serve`
